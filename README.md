### Supplemental Material: Incorporating Intergenic Regions into Reversal and Transposition Distances with Indels

The file *Supplemental Material.pdf* presents examples of the main concepts used in the algorithms proposed in the paper and experimental results using simulated data.

The folder *code/Instances* has a script to generate a set of random instances. Furthermore, it has the datasets used in the experiments reported in the supplemental material of the paper.

The approximation algorithms described in the paper are in the folder *code/algorithms*.
